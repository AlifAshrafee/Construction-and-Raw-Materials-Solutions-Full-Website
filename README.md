# Construction-and-Raw-Materials-Solutions-Full-Website
Our 3-1 project with collaboration from all teammates. This repository contains front end design using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery (for animation), JS(for form validation) and also back-end using Django for implementing login, sign up and search. The Django functions have been modified to integrate with Oracle database using PL/SQL.
